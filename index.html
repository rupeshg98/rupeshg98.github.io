					<p>This is a project that utilizes supervised machine learning to predict offensive NBA stats for the 2020 NBA draftees. The training set is consisted of a preprocessed CSV file containing collegiate stats, body vitals, and professional stats for the top rookies of the last 10 years. These rookies must have played 70% of the season and must have significant minutes per game. They also must have played basketball at a university in the United States - international rookies are not included. The test set is consisted of the collegiate stats and body vitals for 10 draftees and the goal is to predict what their professional stats will be. This project uses K-nearest neighbor regression. A more accurate model can be produced with more body parameters, such as wingspan, shoulder width, vertical, etc. In addition, a player's role on an NBA team heavily differs from their role on a college team.
